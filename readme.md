# 🔍 Customer Credit Risk Simulation & Monitoring – Project Overview

This repository contains a complete, end-to-end solution for simulating, analyzing, and monitoring **customer delinquency and credit risk** in a utility billing context. It consists of three core components:

* 🏗 **Data Simulation** – A behavioral simulation engine to create realistic billing and delinquency records
* 🧠 **ML Classification** – Feature engineering and modeling to classify accounts into risk tiers
* 📊 **Power BI Dashboard** – Visual reporting to monitor account risk, delinquency progression, and operational KPIs

## ✅ Getting Started

If you'd like to run the simulation or modeling locally:

1. Navigate to the corresponding folder (`01_Data_Simulation/` or `02_Credit_Risk_Modeling/`)
2. Create a Python environment (`requirements.txt` or conda YAML)
3. Run notebooks or scripts as outlined in their README files
